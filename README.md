# AVLTree
a basic Swift implementation of the [AVLTree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree) data structure, a type of self-balancing binary search tree.

It offers `O(log(n))` average and worst-case insertion and deletion of elements, where `n` is the number of elements contained in the tree. It offers ordered enumeration over the `n` elements contained in the tree in `O(n)` time.

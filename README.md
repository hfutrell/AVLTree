# AVLTree
a basic Swift implementation of the [AVLTree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree) data structure, a type of self-balancing binary search tree.

For an AVLTree containing `n` elements insertion and deletion of an element is performed in `O(log(n))` for both the average and worst case. 

Since it is a binary tree ordered enumeration over each element is accomplished in `O(n)` time.
